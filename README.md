# Simple-Calculator
This is a calculator application written in C# using the Windows Forms framework. 
The application has a graphical user interface with buttons for performing arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation),
as well as two text boxes for inputting numbers. 
The result of the arithmetic operation is displayed in a label. 
The application checks to make sure that both text boxes have input before performing any operations and displays an error message if they do not.
